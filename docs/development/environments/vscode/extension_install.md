# Bulk Extension Installation

If you want to install VSCode extensions suggested by Rudolf, you can follow these steps.
1. Open [this file](extension_install_command).
2. Copy the contents.
3. Open VSCode.
4. Open a new terminal
5. Paste the file content in the terminal.

This should install all the extensions (can take a while). This setup is a bit general case, with a heavy focus on python and django naturally.
