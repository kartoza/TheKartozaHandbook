1. Lightweight postman alternative inside vsc

2. Manage all your unit tests in a neat organised side bar in vsc - check docs for install guide. Also works with basically all test frameworks!

5. Django snippets - this extension is a bit hidden away for some reason. This is really awesome for django dev specific snippets for models, forms, views etc. really useful!

6. Python Docstrings - but I'm sure there are better extensions :thinking_face:

   I have a few other quality of life extensions:
   https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscode-icons-team.vscode-icons - essential
   https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=adam-watters.vscode-color-pick - front end devs looking for colour codes
   https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=johnpapa.vscode-peacock - livens up vsc theme with a splash of colour
   https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=formulahendry.auto-rename-tag - html auto rename the closing tag
   https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=formulahendry.auto-close-tag - creates closing tag (helpful when using html in not html files like Vue, but might be unnecessary lol)

   -All the intellisense extensions for all the languages :)
   A lot of these extensions have alternatives as well so it's recommended to play around with a few of them.

## SQL

Use postgresql for everything. Dbeaver and Pgadmin are good tools.
