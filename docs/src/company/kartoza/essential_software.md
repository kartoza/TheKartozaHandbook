In this section we will enumerate all of the software packages you should have installed on your computer. There are some items that can be considered optional, but you should be aware of all of these tools and install them when and as the need arises.

In addition to essential software, there are many useful packages that you should be aware of that can be occassionally used to improve your productivity. Tim maintains a list of these declaratively in his [Nix Config Repo](https://github.com/timlinux/nix-config).
