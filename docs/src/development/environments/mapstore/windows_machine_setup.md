**Mapstore requires two disitinct set of tools: Apache Maven for Java and NPM for JavaScript**

## Installing Maven for Windows

### 1.Maven Download

1. Download Maven [link](https://dlcdn.apache.org/maven/maven-3/3.8.6/binaries/apache-maven-3.8.6-bin.zip)
2. Extract the downloaded file to a folder that is accesible

### 2.Add MAVEN_HOME System Variable

1. Open System Enviroment Variables(this needs to be opened in admin mode)
2. Click on the button "Enviroment Variables..."
3. Add a new user variable called _MAVEN_HOME_
4. Edit the "Path" variable under System variables
5. Enter _%MAVEN_HOME%\bin_ in the new field. CLick OK to save changes to the variable
6. Open the command prompt and type _mvn -version_ to make sure installtion was succesful

**Make sure that JAVA_HOME system variable is configured properly and pointing to the version of java you are using**
**Java files can usually be found at _C:\Program Files\Java_**

## Installing Node.js and NPM

1. Download Node.js from the following [link](https://nodejs.org/dist/v18.12.0/node-v18.12.0-x64.msi)
2. Follow installer instructions

## Quick Setup and run of MapStore

- Clone the repository to your current working folder
  _git clone https://github.com/geosolutions-it/MapStore2.git_ in the terminal
- Run _npm cache clean_ in the terminal
- Run _npm install_ in the terminal

_Note: If you're struggling to run the local backend instance use the online instance of MapStore as the backend._

### Swap out local instance of backend for online instance

1. Open the following file _MapStore2/build/DevServer.js_
2. Set the variable MAPSTORE_BACKEND_URL to the url *https://dev-mapstore.geosolutionsgroup.com/mapstore*

_Changing the MAPSTORE_BACKEND_URL in console using >set MAPSTORE_BACKEND_URL=https://dev-mapstore.geosolutionsgroup.com/mapstore did not work on my machine_

### Start front end

- Run _npm run fe:start_ in the terminal to start the app. The app does take some time to install, please be patient

### Running the back end

**Please note the backend works with jdk version 1.8. Any version higher than that and the build fails**
- Run backend with *npm run be:start*

### Build a .war file 

**When running ./build.sh the following error appears "Unable to move the cache: Access is denied" The build does not continue after this point**

*When running the command **mvn compile war:war -e** the following error appears: Error assembling WAR: webxml attribute is required (or pre-existing WEB-INF/web.xml if executing in update mode) *
- To try and remedy this error I added the following in the product/pom.xml 
- `<plugin>
            <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
            <artifactId>maven-war-plugin</artifactId>
            <extensions>false</extensions>
            <version>2.1.1</version>
            <configuration>
                <overlays>
                    <overlay>
                        <groupId>it.geosolutions.mapstore</groupId>
                        <artifactId>mapstore-webapp</artifactId>
                        **<failOnMissingWebXml>false</failOnMissingWebXml>**   
                    </overlay>
                </overlays>
            </configuration>
        </plugin>`
- This not did fix the error. Still investigating a fix
