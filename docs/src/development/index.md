Kartoza is a consulting and development firm. In many instances, projects require developers to leverage existing tools and codebases, and to work with other organisations in a way that is consistent in their own conventions.

This documentation seeks to outline processes and practices so that internal project development and practices within the team remain consistent. Where it is noted that beneficial conventions listed here are not implemented in client projects, recommendations may be made that clients adopt such standards.

For the most part, however, it is less a concern of how a particular outcome is achieved, but rather that the result is consistent with the appropriate conventions.
